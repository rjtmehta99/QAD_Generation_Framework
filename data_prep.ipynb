Messenger RNA (mRNA) copies from the DNA, exports itself from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and contains information for constructing proteins. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a part of the ribosomes at the site of protein synthesis; whereas, transfer RNA (tRNA) carries the amino acid to the site of protein synthesis. The microRNA regulates using mRNA for protein synthesis.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'subject': 'biology', 'topic': ' Nucleic Acids', 'classification': {'score': 0.8374455571174622, 'details': {'chemistry': 0.1594080626964569, 'biology': 0.8374455571174622, 'physics': 0.0031464078929275274}, 'label': 'biology'}}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '6cd7d16f891c686abe236a0190b7bb37'}>,\n",
